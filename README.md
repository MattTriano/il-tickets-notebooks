# Chicago Tickets Example Notebooks

ProPublica Illinois and WBEZ [cleaned and released](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/chicago-parking-ticket-data) the records for all parking and vehicle compliance tickets in Chicago from Jan. 1, 2007 to May 14, 2018.

This repository contains a sample of that data and is intended to be a community resource for those who want to work with this data by providing notebooks with analysis and visualization.

To contribute, fork this repository, add a Jupyter notebook (Python and R preferred), and submit a pull request.

See the notebook entitled [start-here.ipynb](start_here.ipynb).
